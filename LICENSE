Thanks to Rodney Brown <rbrown64@csc.com.au> for his contribution of faster
CRC methods: exclusive-oring 32 bits of data at a time, and pre-computing
tables for updating the shift register in one step with three exclusive-ors
instead of four steps with four exclusive-ors.  This results in about a
factor of two increase in speed on a Power PC G4 (PPC7455) using gcc -O3.
